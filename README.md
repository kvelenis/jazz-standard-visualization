Jazz Standards Visualization with Play Along Functionality

This Git repository contains code, data, and resources for visualizing 1048 jazz standard songs using dimensionality reduction techniques. The songs' audio features were processed using a transformer model and reduced to a lower-dimensional space using t-SNE. The resulting data is presented in an interactive 3D scatter plot, enabling users to explore the songs.

Additionally, the repository includes a player that facilitates play-along purposes. The player renders the present chord and provides information about the upcoming chords, allowing musicians to practice and perform along with the songs. The visualization and play-along functionality enhance the understanding and enjoyment of the jazz standard repertoire.

The repository encompasses the necessary code, data files, and documentation to reproduce the visualization, customize its features, and utilize the play-along functionality.
